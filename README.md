# system-setup

* `.vimrc` - Guide to setup custom vim editor with key bindings and plugins to make it productive and pretier :)
* `Ubuntu-aws.md` - Deploying flask based web application on an ubuntu machine (tested on an aws instance)



Screenshot of resulting theme from using `.vimrc` file in the repository. Watch my [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs4MBcEUrMk) on how to get started with setting up this theme
Note - Current version has arrow keys disabled in the normal mode for me to get used to `J, K, H, L` navigation.
